# Setup Process Recap

## Initial Environment Setup

1. **Node.js Installation**
   - Initially encountered `zsh: command not found: npm` error
   - Had to install Node.js using Homebrew
   - Steps taken:
     ```bash
     # Install Homebrew first
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     
     # Add Homebrew to PATH
     echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
     eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
     
     # Install Node.js
     brew install node
     ```
   - Resulted in Node.js v23.7.0 and npm v10.9.2 being installed

## Project Dependencies

1. **Package Installation**
   - Ran `npm install` to install project dependencies
   - Installed packages including:
     - React and React DOM for frontend
     - Express.js for backend
     - Drizzle ORM for database
     - Various UI components from Radix UI
     - Development tools like TypeScript and Vite

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Set up `.env` file with necessary configurations:
     - Database credentials for Neon PostgreSQL
     - OpenAI API key
     - Spotify API credentials
     - Session secret
     - Server port configuration

## Server Configuration

1. **Database Setup**
   - Configured Neon PostgreSQL connection
   - Set up Drizzle ORM
   - Successfully ran `npm run db:push` to initialize database schema

2. **Environment Variable Loading**
   - Added `dotenv` package for environment variable management
   - Modified `server/index.ts` to load environment variables
   - Added proper TypeScript types for configuration

3. **Port Configuration Issues**
   - Initially encountered port conflicts on port 5000
   - Changed server to use port 3000
   - Had to handle port conflict resolution:
     ```bash
     # Check for processes using port
     lsof -i :3000
     
     # Kill conflicting process
     kill <PID>
     ```

## Final Working State

The application is now running with:
- Frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000
- Backend API endpoints at http://localhost:3000/api/*
- Database connection established
- Environment variables properly loaded
- All integrations (OpenAI, Spotify) configured

## Key Learnings
1. Importance of proper environment setup (Node.js, npm)
2. Managing environment variables with dotenv
3. Handling port conflicts in development
4. Database configuration and connection
5. TypeScript configuration for type safety

## Running the Application
To start the application:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :<port>  # Check what's using the port
   kill <PID>       # Kill the process if needed
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all required variables are in `.env`
   - Make sure dotenv is properly configured

3. **Database Connection**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL format
   - Run `npm run db:push` to sync schema
